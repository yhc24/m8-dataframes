# Exercise 5: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
grants <- read.csv("gates_money.csv")

# Use the View function to look at your data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset
spending <- grants$total_amount

# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function

is.vector(spending)
# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.
# Unfortunately, it will not be a vector by default, so you must transform it using the as.vector function
org <- grants$organization
as.vector(org)

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?
mean.grants <- mean(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
largest.grant <- max(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
smallest.grant <- min(grants$total_amount)
# Which organization received the largest grant?
org.largestgrand<-grants$organization[spending == largest.grant]
# Which organization received the smallest grant?

org.smallestgrand<- grants$organization[spending == smallest.grant]
# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
length(spending[grants$start_year == 2010])
